# Introduction
Self driving cars and driver assistance is a major field of study in technology today.  Almost all major automakers are looking to improve or develop safer cars or to automate them to drive themselves.  Our project focuses on this problem.  We are developing a Nerual Network that will be able to read and distiguish different road signs and thus improving accuracy.
